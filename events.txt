EventProcessor:

	Each processor has a priority, which affects the order in which processors get access to the queue.
	Processors may "cancel" an event, which effectively nullifies it.
	Processors may "react" with further events, pushing them onto the back of the queue.
	Combining "cancel" and "react" effectively replaces the event.
	Processors may choose to simply ignore events.
